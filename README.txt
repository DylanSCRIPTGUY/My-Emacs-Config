### MY PERSONAL EMACS CONFIG ###

This is my personal emacs config file.
It looks amazing, it is simple, and it is really
small.

(To see what it looks like, look at the screenshot)

!!WARNING!!

This emacs config disables the creation of backup files!
So if you want to keep them, edit that before you use it!



Also, this is designed for Vanilla/GNU Emacs. I have never
used Doom Emacs so I have absolutely no idea if it will
work properly on it.

And one last thing, it doesn't really work on -nw at all
